#+TITLE: =bgfx= - Haskell bindings to the [[https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx][bgfx]] project

Currently low-level Haskell bindings to the [[https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx][bgfx]] project, exposing a very C-like
interface. In the future we hope to abstract over this to provide Haskell-like
bindings too. Currently supports most of =bgfx=, the =cubes= example has been
ported.
